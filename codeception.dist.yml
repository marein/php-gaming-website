# We want a high test coverage for our business logic and some special classes.
# Other parts are covered by acceptance tests, which have no coverage report.
#
# Libraries in the /src/Common folder have tests but are not counted in the coverage report.
# Those libraries are meant to be split out in the future. They don't belong to this project.
