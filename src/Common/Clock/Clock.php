/**
 * Read this before you rant on this singleton.
 *
 * This class exists only for unit testing purposes.
 * There is a good reason why I don't use another clock abstraction like https://github.com/lcobucci/clock in this
 * application. Mainly because I only have "new \DateTimeImmutable()" calls which I need to mock. I don't want
 * to provide a clock instance up to my entities. That would be the case if I used dependency injection.
 * Nearly everything would need it. That's why I treat "new \DateTimeImmutable()" as a function which I can replace.
 * In tests I can freeze the DateTime to a specific value. I've also a direct dependency to ramsey/uuid in my entities.
 * So why not this simple clock abstraction? If I need more or want an explicit clock dependency, I can still go
 * with dependency injection later on.
 *
 * There is a good read about this here
 * https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2008/11/09/systemtime-versus-isystemclock-dependencies-revisited/
 *
 * And yes, you would never freeze the DateTime in production.
